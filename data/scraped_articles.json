            "text": "Prior to Manchester United\u2019s previous Premier League match, which was against Newcastle United, there were speculations that if Man United ended on the losing side, manager Jose Mourinho would find himself out of the club.\n\nThe nightmare had turned almost into reality when Man United trailed Newcastle by 0-2 at the half-time break. The hosts fought back to equalise before Sanchez scored a late header to complete a remarkable 3-2 turnaround against Rafael Benitez's side.\n\nIn last week\u2019s international break, Sanchez scored the lone goal in Chile\u2019s 1-0 win over Mexico and on Saturday, he found himself on the bench yet again as Man United are set to play Chelsea at the Stamford Bridge.\n\nEver since Sanchez made a transfer from Arsenal to Man United during the January transfer window, nothing has gone right with the forward.\n\nThe winner he scored against Newcastle was just his third league goal for Man United and first of the season. That contrasted with his spectacular 24 goals during a full campaign with Arsenal in the 2016-17 season.\n\nAccording to reports, Manchester City targeted Sanchez first during the summer transfer window but Pep Guardiola\u2019s \u00a360m offer was rejected before he was defeated by rivals Man United.\n\nFormer England great, Tim Sherwood, has suggested that had Sanchez joined City, things would be looking very different.\n\n\"I think he made the wrong decision. He had the opportunity to go to Man City, and if he took that option he would be a superstar now. For whatever reason, he chose to go to Manchester United, and it hasn't worked out.\n\nIt's money, possibly, and that's up to him but you can't argue that he's not chosen one of the biggest clubs in the world. He possibly didn't know how it would turn out, and he couldn't have imagined what a nightmare it would be for him,\u201d Sherwood said.\n\n\"Hopefully he bounces and goes into the next game with a shot in the arm after the goal he scored against Newcastle, a winning goal, which got everyone lifted and hopefully he'll take that performance to show what he can do.\n\n\"But at the moment, he's been nothing like the Alexis Sanchez we've seen in the Premier League and loved to watch for five or six years,\u201d former English midfielder added.\n\nChelsea vs Manchester United teams:\n\nManchester United: De Gea; Young, Smalling, Lindelof, Shaw; Matic, Pogba; Martial, Rashford, Mata; Lukaku.\n\nSubstitutes: Romero, Bailly, Darmian, Pereira, Herrera, Fred, Sanchez.\n\nChelsea: Kepa; Azpilicueta, Luiz, Rudiger, Alonso; Jorginho, Kant\u00e9, Kovacic; Willian, Morata, Hazard.\n\nSubstitutes: Caballero, Cahill, Zappacosta, Fabregas, Barkley, Pedro, Giroud.",

            "text": "The World Wide Fund for Nature-India (WWF-India) along with the Uttar Pradesh forest department recently held a survey of Ganga River Dolphins and found that the dolphin population has increased from 22 in 2015 to 33 in 2018. The survey under the \u2018My Ganga, My Dolphin\u2019 programme was conducted from October 10-15 over a stretch of nearly 205km, spanning Bijnor barrage to Narora barrage along the river.\n\nOfficials said the 33 dolphins found during the survey included three calves and claimed that it indicated that the slow -breeding dolphins have flourished on the stretch and also indicates positive river health and biodiversity.\n\n\u201cThe major dolphin population is found beyond Allahabad, Varanasi and Balia districts, besides a small population found between the two barrages in western UP. In the survey, we found 30 adults and three calves. This is an encouraging sign as dolphins are slow breeders but their population is increasing as they find sustainable environments and habitat,\u201d Sanjeev Yadav, senior coordinator from WWF-India, said.\n\n\u201cThese dolphins breed every two or three years. Finding three calves amongst a small population is encouraging. A normal dolphin here has a length of 1-1.5 metre. The two barrages are close and it is one of the pristine habitats and is rich in biodiversity,\u201d he added.\n\nThe survey covered a 106.9km stretch from Bijnor to Garhmukteshwar, which is along the Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary, and another 98km stretch from Garhmukteshwar to Narora which is a Ramsar site.\n\nThe Convention of Wetlands, called the Ramsar Convention, is the intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for the conservation and proper use of wetlands and resources. India became a party to the convention in February 1982. India has 26 sites designated Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Sites).\n\n\u201cThe figures in the survey are encouraging as calves have been found, which means they are breeding. This is an indicator that the stretch is a suitable habitat for dolphins. Here, we also have a population of Ghariyals. We have \u2018water schools\u2019 run by WWF-India, to help sustain dolphins, and sensitise village residents. They now regard dolphins as a part of their ecosystem,\u201d Lalit Verma, conservator of forests (Meerut), UP forest department, said.\n\nUnder the concept of \u2018water schools,\u2019 agencies have identified nearly 70 schools near the stretch and are sensitising students about the environment, biodiversity and the need to conserve the species.\n\nThe Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista Gangetica), or \u2018Susu,\u2019 is one of the two subspecies of the South Asian River Dolphin, the other being the Indus Dolphin \u2018bhulan\u2019 found in the Indus river in Pakistan, and Beas in India.\n\nThe four other freshwater dolphins in the world are the Amazon river dolphin \u2018Boto\u2019; Bolivian river dolphin; the Araguaian river Dolphin, and the Chinese Dolphin ,\u2018Baiji\u2019, in China\u2019s Yangtze river, which is reported to have been extinct since 2006.\n\nThe Ganges River Dolphin is also flagged as the \u2018Tiger of the Ganges\u2019, and is considered the mascot of a healthy aquatic environment and acts as an indicator species. According to officials, they are found in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Recent population estimates in its entire distribution range recorded around 3,000 individuals. Out of this, more than 80% are within Indian territory.\n\nThe Bijnor to Narora Ramsar site is vital as it houses dolphins as well as \u2018critically endangered\u2019 Ghariyals. A programme for the reintroduction Ghariyals has been in place on the stretch since 2009.\n\nFirst Published: Oct 18, 2018 15:01 IST",
