Repeated TV replays showed the ball had bounced before nestling into Delhi wicket-keeper Unmukt Chand's gloves.\n\nTare eventually fell prey to Manan Sharma, trapped plumb in front of the wicket in the 31st over but by then he had already taken Mumbai to sniffing distance of a win. Lad's valiant 48 came off 68 deliveries with four boundaries and two sixes but he fell two short of his half-century, caught by Dhruv Shorey off Lalit Yadav with Mumbai scoreboard reading 176 for six.\n\nLad also survived a run out appeal at the non-strikers end after the umpires could not come to a conclusive proof to suggest that the straight drive off Tare hit the boots of Subodh Bhati and ricocheted onto the stumps.\n\nThe benefit of doubt went in favour of the batsman.\n\nChasing 178, Mumbai lost in-form Prithvi Shaw for eight in third ball of the innings after he smashed two consecutive boundaries of Navdeep Saini.\n\nAjinkya Rahane (10), captain Shreyas Iyer (7) and Suryakumar Yadav (4) all departed cheaply to Saini and Kulwant Khejrolia, leaving Mumbai struggling at 40 for four in 7.4 overs.\n\nEarlier, Delhi began their innings on a bad note with Mumbai pacers Kulkarni and Tushar Deshpande exploiting the moist conditions.\n\nDeshpande (2/30), Dubey and Kulkarni picked up eight wickets between them to rattle Delhi's batting line-up.\n\nCaptain Gautam Gambhir got out for one in second over off the innings. Soon Unmukt Chand (13) and Manan Sharma (5) also went cheaply.\n\nDelhi were reeling at 21 for three in six overs, but Nitish Rana (13) and Dhruv Shorey (31) tried to stabilise the innings for a brief period before the former was removed by Dubey, leaving Delhi precariously placed at 60 for four.\n\nShorey too did not last long as he was stumped by Tare off a brilliant Shams Mulani's delivery.\n\nThereafter, Pawan Negi (21), Subodh Bhati (25) and Himmat Singh (41) scored vital runs to take Delhi to 177.\n\nBut once Negi walked back to the pavilion retired hurt, Mumbai ran through Delhi's tail in quick time.",

            "text": "The World Wide Fund for Nature-India (WWF-India) along with the Uttar Pradesh forest department recently held a survey of Ganga River Dolphins and found that the dolphin population has increased from 22 in 2015 to 33 in 2018. The survey under the \u2018My Ganga, My Dolphin\u2019 programme was conducted from October 10-15 over a stretch of nearly 205km, spanning Bijnor barrage to Narora barrage along the river.\n\nOfficials said the 33 dolphins found during the survey included three calves and claimed that it indicated that the slow -breeding dolphins have flourished on the stretch and also indicates positive river health and biodiversity.\n\n\u201cThe major dolphin population is found beyond Allahabad, Varanasi and Balia districts, besides a small population found between the two barrages in western UP. In the survey, we found 30 adults and three calves. This is an encouraging sign as dolphins are slow breeders but their population is increasing as they find sustainable environments and habitat,\u201d Sanjeev Yadav, senior coordinator from WWF-India, said.\n\n\u201cThese dolphins breed every two or three years. Finding three calves amongst a small population is encouraging. A normal dolphin here has a length of 1-1.5 metre. The two barrages are close and it is one of the pristine habitats and is rich in biodiversity,\u201d he added.\n\nThe survey covered a 106.9km stretch from Bijnor to Garhmukteshwar, which is along the Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary, and another 98km stretch from Garhmukteshwar to Narora which is a Ramsar site.\n\nThe Convention of Wetlands, called the Ramsar Convention, is the intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for the conservation and proper use of wetlands and resources. India became a party to the convention in February 1982. India has 26 sites designated Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Sites).\n\n\u201cThe figures in the survey are encouraging as calves have been found, which means they are breeding. This is an indicator that the stretch is a suitable habitat for dolphins. Here, we also have a population of Ghariyals. We have \u2018water schools\u2019 run by WWF-India, to help sustain dolphins, and sensitise village residents. They now regard dolphins as a part of their ecosystem,\u201d Lalit Verma, conservator of forests (Meerut), UP forest department, said.\n\nUnder the concept of \u2018water schools,\u2019 agencies have identified nearly 70 schools near the stretch and are sensitising students about the environment, biodiversity and the need to conserve the species.\n\nThe Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista Gangetica), or \u2018Susu,\u2019 is one of the two subspecies of the South Asian River Dolphin, the other being the Indus Dolphin \u2018bhulan\u2019 found in the Indus river in Pakistan, and Beas in India.\n\nThe four other freshwater dolphins in the world are the Amazon river dolphin \u2018Boto\u2019; Bolivian river dolphin; the Araguaian river Dolphin, and the Chinese Dolphin ,\u2018Baiji\u2019, in China\u2019s Yangtze river, which is reported to have been extinct since 2006.\n\nThe Ganges River Dolphin is also flagged as the \u2018Tiger of the Ganges\u2019, and is considered the mascot of a healthy aquatic environment and acts as an indicator species. According to officials, they are found in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Recent population estimates in its entire distribution range recorded around 3,000 individuals. Out of this, more than 80% are within Indian territory.\n\nThe Bijnor to Narora Ramsar site is vital as it houses dolphins as well as \u2018critically endangered\u2019 Ghariyals. A programme for the reintroduction Ghariyals has been in place on the stretch since 2009.\n\nFirst Published: Oct 18, 2018 15:01 IST",
